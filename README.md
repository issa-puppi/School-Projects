# My School Projects
Newly made a Github, currently in the process of uploading my projects to my repositories so stay tuned! 
This will be the home to all of the code that I have not lost to an unfortunate HDD corruption at the beginning of my Junior Year.
Rest assure, more than just a README.md will be here in time! Hope you stay tuned and give my projects a look.
